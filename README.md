# Child_Aid_Programs_Impact

Increasing research evidence has indicated the meaningful effect nutrition and family income between the ages of 0 to 5 has on child development (Birch & Gussow 1970; Duncan & Brooks-Gunn 1997). You have been hired as a research consultant for an evaluation study examining the effect of the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Nutrition Program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program participation during pregnancy on child reading achievement. This is a large evaluation study using a national probability sample, the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and thus has meaningful policy implications.

Using the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (“good”), the evaluation team has asked you to examine if the effect of WIC program participation during pregnancy is moderated by (1) family income, (2) race, and (3) the current age of the child. Although assumptions still need to be evaluated it is not necessary to report the evaluation of the assumptions as was asked for in assignment 2. Simply state what changes were made to the data and model in order to account for assumption violations.

The report should include: the descriptive statistics (i.e. N, means/medians/proportions, standard deviations, frequencies, observed ranges, and correlations) of the variables and the multiple regression analyses with interaction effects. You are asked to provide in a one to two paragraph concluding statement your interpretation of the results and what they suggest. In an appendix, the evaluation team would like to see the syntax of your R program.

Definition of Variables:
• WICpreg – Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Nutrition Program participant during
pregnancy: 0 = No, 1 = Yes.
• Race – Centered Binary Coding of Race: -0.5 = Black, 0.5 = White.
• mathraw97 – Woodcock-Johnson Revised Mathematics Achievement Test Raw Score.
Minimum = 0, Maximum = 98.
• age97 – The child’s age in 1997. Minimum = 3, Maximum = 13.
• faminc97 – Total family income in 1997 (in 2002 constant dollars). Minimum = $-
72296.26, Maximum = $784610.59.
• bthwht – Low birth weight status of the child. 0 = non-low birth weight child, 1 = low
birth weight child.
• HOME97 – A composite total score of the emotional and cognitive stimulation at home.
Minimum = 7, Maximum = 27.
